# biotransfer

## Overview
Methods for learning biological sequence representations from large, general purpose protein datasets have demonstrated impressive ability to capture structural and functional properties of proteins. However, existing works have not yet investigated the value, limitations and opportunities of these methods in application to antibody-based drug discovery. This work provides necessary tools, models and data for comparing three classes of models: conventional statistical sequence models, supervised learning on each dataset independently, and fine-tuning an antibody specific pre-trained embedding model. 

## Setup
(1) Install the virtual environment by running "conda env create -f environment.yaml".  

(2) Switch to the new conda environment with "conda activate <env_name>". Here the env_name is "biotransfer" as defined in environment.yaml

(3) Create the config file that will run your application, and make sure the filesystem has access to the data and dataset/model source code. Use existing config files/datasets/models for guidance on how to build a new one. 

## Training a Language Model
- To run interactively, use "python train_from_config.py --config-path=\<config path here\>".  
- To run in multirun, use "python train_from_config.py --config-path=\<config path here\> -m".  
  
## Evaluating a Language model
- To run interactively, use "python eval_from_config.py --config-path=\<config path here\>".  
- To run in multirun, use "python eval_from_config.py --config-path=\<config path here\> -m". 

## Training a Downstream Model with Gaussian Process
- To run interactively, use "python train_GP.py --config-path=\<config path here\>".  
- To run in multirun, use "python train_GP.py --config-path=\<config path here\> -m". 

## Evaluating a Downstream Model with Gaussian Process
- To run interactively, use "python eval_GP.py --config-path=\<config path here\>".  
- To run in multirun, use "python eval_GP.py --config-path=\<config path here\> -m".
